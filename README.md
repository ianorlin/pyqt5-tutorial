The PyQt5-Tutorial is an introductory guide through the widgets available in the Qt5 toolkit, combined with the use of Python 3.

The tutorial does not guide through the building process of an application from start to finish, but rather provides the methods and signals used by each widget, and a description of how each works.

The main github repository for this documentation is [https://github.com/steeleyuk/pyqt5-tutorial]{https://github.com/steeleyuk/pyqt5-tutorial}
