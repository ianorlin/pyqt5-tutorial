Introduction
============

===============
Getting Started
===============
Before starting with GUI programming in any language or using any toolkit, it is required to have a good understanding of the programming language in use. In the case of Python, it is important to know about variables and their types, using functions, and dealing with loops and if statements. It is suggested that the developer be capable of writing simple scripts and have some experience of using other modules.

This tutorial does not guide through the process of building an application from start to finish. It simply provides an overview of each widget in Qt, and shows how they work, combined with a simple example showcasing the widget basics.

Versioning
==========
This tutorial was written on Ubuntu 14.10, with the examples developed and tested using Python 3.4.2 and Qt/PyQt 5.3.2. Although older versions may work for the most part, there may be some issues with missing methods, and bugs. Typically, the more up-to-date the software, the easier the development should be.
